# Conversation About Children

**Alex:** Hey Jamie, I was wondering - how often do you play with children?

**Jamie:** Honestly, not very often. I prefer spending time with adults, and I find it challenging to connect with kids. What about you?

**Alex:** I occasionally play with my niece, but I have to admit I get a bit overwhelmed after a while. Do children make you feel annoyed sometimes?

**Jamie:** Yes, especially when they're being noisy in public places. I find it stressful to be around children for long periods. Have you ever had a particularly difficult experience with a child?

**Alex:** Oh yes! Once, my friend's child was running around a restaurant, knocking things over, and the parents just laughed it off. It drove me crazy! What's your worst experience with a child?

**Jamie:** I had a neighbor's kid who would constantly ring my doorbell and run away. It was really frustrating. But I would never hit a child, no matter how annoying they are. Have you ever lost your temper with a child?

**Alex:** No, I've never hit a child. I believe in setting boundaries politely. Do you think it's okay to not like children?

**Jamie:** Absolutely! To each their own. Some people prefer adult company, and that's perfectly fine. When you see a child misbehaving, who do you think is to blame - the parents or the child?

**Alex:** I think it's usually the parents' responsibility. Children learn from their environment. What's your take on this?

**Jamie:** I agree, but I also think it's useless to accuse children of mischievous behaviors to their parents. Why do you think that might be?

**Alex:** Because parents often get defensive and don't want to hear criticism about their parenting. They might feel judged. How do you handle situations when children are misbehaving in public?

**Jamie:** I usually try to remove myself from the situation or politely ask the parents to intervene. What's your strategy?

**Alex:** I prefer to focus on my own space and not get involved. Do you think society puts too much pressure on people to like children?

**Jamie:** Definitely! There's a stigma attached to admitting you don't enjoy being around children. How do you deal with this social pressure?

**Alex:** I'm honest about my preferences while being respectful of others' choices. What about you?

**Jamie:** I try to set clear boundaries and communicate my feelings openly. Do you think this topic should be discussed more openly in society?

**Alex:** Yes, I think open conversations can help reduce misunderstandings. What's the most important thing you've learned about dealing with children?

**Jamie:** That patience and respect go both ways - we should respect children's space as much as we expect them to respect ours.
